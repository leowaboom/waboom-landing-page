## Generated LinkedIn Post

Your receptionist costs $52,000 a year.

Here's what they actually do with their time:

- 40% answering routine questions (hours, location, pricing)
- 25% transferring calls they can't handle
- 20% on hold with insurance companies
- 15% doing the job you actually hired them for

An AI voice agent handles the first 65% instantly.
24/7. No sick days. No lunch breaks. No turnover.

One of our clients runs a 4-location dental group.
Before: 2 full-time receptionists per location. $416,000/year.
After: 1 receptionist per location + AI. $208,000/year. Same patient satisfaction scores.

That's not replacing people. That's letting people do human work instead of robot work.

The question isn't whether AI will handle your calls.
It's whether you'll be the one using it, or competing against someone who does.
