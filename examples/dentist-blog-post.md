### Your Patients Are Ghosting You. Here's What It's Costing.

38% of dental appointments end in no-shows.

Read that again. More than a third of your booked schedule just... doesn't turn up.

At an average appointment value of $250, a practice seeing 20 patients a day loses roughly $1,900 every single day to empty chairs. That's $475,000 a year in revenue that was booked, confirmed, and then vanished.

Most practices "solve" this with a receptionist making reminder calls. But here's what actually happens. Your receptionist is already juggling check-ins, insurance queries, and the phone that won't stop ringing. Reminder calls get bumped. Some go out late. Some never go out at all.

And when patients do need to reschedule? They call after hours. They get voicemail. They don't leave a message. They book with the practice down the road that actually answered.

**The fix isn't more staff. It's smarter systems.**

AI voice agents handle appointment reminders automatically. Not a text that gets ignored. An actual phone call, at the right time, with the ability to reschedule on the spot.

Practices using automated voice reminders see no-show rates drop from 38% to under 12%.

That's not a marginal improvement. That's recovering $300,000+ per year in revenue that was already yours.

The AI handles after-hours calls too. Patient calls at 9pm with a cracked tooth? The AI books them into tomorrow's emergency slot. No voicemail. No missed opportunity.

**Your chairs shouldn't be empty. Your phone shouldn't go unanswered. And your receptionist shouldn't be doing three jobs.**
