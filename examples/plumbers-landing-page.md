Most customers don't notice. The AI uses natural conversation patterns and local accents. It handles common plumbing questions naturally.

**What happens if the AI can't handle a call?**
Complex calls are seamlessly transferred to your team with a full summary of the conversation so the customer never has to repeat themselves.
