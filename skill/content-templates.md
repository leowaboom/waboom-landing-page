## Blog Posts (Alex Hormozi Rules)

**CRITICAL: Write like Hormozi thinks. Tight. Punchy. Results first. Conversational.**

**The Rules:**
1. **Open with stakes, not setup** - Show the cost of the problem in the first 3 sentences. Don't tease, deliver.
2. **Specificity wins** - "Hours to minutes" beats "faster follow-up" every time.
3. **Cut ruthlessly** - If a sentence doesn't make them want to read the next one, delete it.
4. **Put your best line at the top** - Don't bury the killer line at the bottom.
5. **Short paragraphs. White space.** - Big blocks = bounce. Let them breathe.
6. **Results before features** - Nobody cares how it works until they care about getting it.
7. **Subheads that pull forward** - Not "The Problem With X" (boring). Try "Why This Costs You $50k" (curious).
8. **Write like you talk** - Rhetorical questions. "Right?" "Make sense?" Sentence fragments.
9. **First person when it fits** - "Here's what I see..." "Let me tell you what happens..."
10. **No hyphens or em dashes** - They look AI written. Use periods instead.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** - Story with stakes. Show someone losing. Make it hurt. (3-5 sentences max)
2. **The Problem** - What's broken. Why it costs them. Conversational, not clinical.
3. **The Fix** - What changes. Keep it simple. Don't over-explain.
4. **The Proof** - Numbers woven into sentences, not tables. Stories > stats.
5. **CTA** - Direct. One action. No fluff.

**Length: 250-400 words.** If you need more, you're waffling.

**Tone:** Direct. Confident. Slightly aggressive. Like you're telling a friend the truth they need to hear. Use "you" a lot. Talk TO them, not AT them.

## Video Scripts (Reels, Ads, YouTube)

**CRITICAL: Embed social proof, urgency, and guarantees naturally. Never list them separately.**

**HOOK** (0-3 seconds)
"What if you could [big outcome 1], [big outcome 2], and [aspirational outcome 3] in [short time]?"

**PROBLEM** (3-10 seconds)
"Most [target audience] struggle with [messy current solution], facing [pain 1], [pain 2], and a [vivid metaphor for chaos] of [extra pain]."

**SOLUTION** (10-20 seconds) - Include social proof
"This is why [type or number of people] rely on [your product or program]."

**OFFER** (20-35 seconds) - Include guarantee/risk reversal
"In [short time frame], you'll [primary result], [secondary benefit], and I'll even show you [secret advantage]."
"And the best part, it costs less than [relatable spend with a touch of humour]."

**CTA** (35-45 seconds)
"To [action plus benefit], [exact step]."

3. **Solution** - How to fix it (tactical, specific)
4. **Proof** - Numbers, case studies, examples
5. **CTA** - Clear next step (not salesy)
