## What This Does

One skill file. Say "Waboom landing page for [industry]" and Claude Code will:

1. **Research** the industry via web search (pain points, statistics, FAQ, competitor positioning)
2. **Write** a complete landing page (headline, problem agitation, features, FAQ, CTA)
3. **Optimise** for SEO and AEO (metadata, JSON-LD schema, FAQPage markup, keyword placement)
4. **Generate** a hero image using Gemini (optional, requires API key)

Every page is personalised to the target industry with real statistics, industry-specific language, and researched pain points.

## Features

- **Research-first workflow** - Searches Google for real industry data before writing a single word
- **SEO/AEO built in** - Auto-generates metadata, JSON-LD schema (Service + FAQPage + LocalBusiness), and optimises for AI answer engines
- **Direct, edgy voice** - Alex Hormozi-inspired writing style. No corporate fluff.
- **Brand voice consistency** - Every page follows the same tone, structure, and quality standard
- **Multi-format content** - Landing pages, blog posts, social posts, video scripts, emails
- **Image generation** - Optional hero images via Gemini (nano-banana-pro MCP server included)
- **Onboarding built in** - Say "Waboom setup" and it asks 10 questions to learn your business

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the skill

```bash
cp -r skill/ ~/.claude/skills/waboom-landing-page/
```

### 2. Set up your business details

Open Claude Code and say:

```
Waboom setup
```

The skill will ask about your company, services, stats, target market, and brand. It generates a personalised `knowledge-base.md` so every piece of content knows your business.

### 3. Generate your first landing page

```
Waboom landing page for electricians
```

Claude will research the electrical industry, write a complete landing page, optimise for SEO/AEO, and generate a hero image (if configured).

2. Add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add nano-banana-pro \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  -- python3 /path/to/mcp-server/nano-banana-pro.py
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r mcp-server/requirements.txt
```

See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.
